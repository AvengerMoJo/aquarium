# I18N

The `Glass` project supports internationalization. This document
describes how to extract and process the translations.

## How to become a translator
If you want to become a translator, please create a new account at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
and join the [Aquarium](https://www.transifex.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/) project.

## Process translations in `Glass`

### Prerequisites
To be able to pull the translations from Transifex, `Python 3` must be
installed on your system.

### Extract translations
To extract the i18n messages from the HTML templates and the TypeScript
files just run the following command in `src/glass`:
```
$ npm run i18n:extract
```
The file `src/glass/src/assets/i18n/aquarium.pot` will be created. This file
must be uploaded manually to Transifex in order to update the source file of
the resource.

### Pull translations
To get the latest translations for every supported language from Transifex
run the following command:
```
$ npm run i18n:pull
```
The `*.po` files for every language (e.g. de_DE.po) will be downloaded into
the directory `src/glass/src/assets/i18n`.

### Convert the translations
Finally, the `*.po` files need to be converted into JSON to be used in
the UI.
```
$ npm run i18n:convert
```
