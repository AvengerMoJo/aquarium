Aquarium Bug and Issue Triaging
===============================

Bug and issue triaging for Aquarium is performed on a weekly basis in
the team meeting on Wednesday at 5pm CEST.

Triaging is performed as follows:

1. GitHub issues labelled as `Bug` are triaged first and foremost. See:
   https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug

   Each issue will be assessed for severity (Nice to Have, Recommended, Required)
   for the following milestone. The issue will then be assigned to a contributing
   member of the community who will be able to further investigate the issue and,
   if required, issue a prognosis.

2. GitHub issues that are assigned to the next upcoming milestone will be
   reviewed next.

   note::

     If any issues were not completed for the previous milestone, ensure they
     are carried across into the next milestone before re-triaging.

   Issues that are *unassigned* but have already been assigned to the appropriate
   milestone will be prioritised accordingly (Nice to Have, Recommended,
   Required) and assigned to a member of the community.

3. Next (time permitting) review all issues in the relevant milestone and
   gather a status update from assignee.

4. Lastly, go through any new issues that do not have a prioritisation or a
   milestone labelled. Engage with the reporter of the issue to determine
   what are the appropriate next steps.

Assigning Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this early stage of Aquarium, we encourage members of the community to
assign issues to themselves that they are interested in. If there is an issue
you are interested in, but someone else is assigned, we further encourage you
to reach out to the individual and work together (if this is an option).

Going forward, the Aquarium community will develop an easier method of
assigning issues. Please bear with us.
