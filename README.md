Aquarist Labs are an organization of like-minded individuals working on the Aquariums project. 

We are investigating the beginnings of a new storage appliance project in an opinionated fashion. The Aquariums project is split into two clearly defined work streams: Gravel (backend) and Glass (frontend). 

## Checking out the source

You can clone from github with

	git clone git@github.com:aquarist-labs/aquarium

or, if you are not a github user,

	git clone git://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium

## What does this project do?

We're not actually sure yet, but the end goal is to make a storage appliance installer.

## Why is this project useful?

Stop asking hard questions.

## How do I get started?

Look at the [issue](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues) list, or
contact the [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/aquarist-labs/people) and
see what's up.

If you want to get your hands dirty as soon as possible, you can also run the
script at `tools/setup-dev.sh`. This will ensure you have a basic development
environment as soon as possible so you can start hacking.

You will be able to find the backend bits in `src/gravel`, while the frontend
bits are located in `src/glass`.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

Oh, oh we're not there yet.
