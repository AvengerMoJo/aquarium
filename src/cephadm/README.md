cephadm
========

This is, literally, a copy of upstream's cephadm tool, added here as a python
module to be used by our backend.

This could probably be a submodule, but no idea how to get just that portion of
the tree. In the meantime, we have written the ceph version from which the
latest version has been obtained into `ceph_version`.

Changes should be, within reason and feasibility, be pushed upstream.
