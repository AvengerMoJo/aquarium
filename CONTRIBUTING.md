## Be Respectful


Although technical in nature, the Open Source community is first and foremost
about people. Treat other people with respect. Be kind, be open, respect the
culture of the community you are interacting with and be aware of the diversity
of people in that community. Be aware that, particularly in electronic communication,
you might misunderstand or misinterpret what others are saying or meaning. The
reverse is also true.
