## How to file a bug report (try using issue and pull request templates)

I recommend clicking "Issue" in [Planning and Discussion](https://github.com/aquarists-labs/planning-and-discussion/issues) and filing one. Be nice, though.

## How to suggest a new feature

You can suggest a new feature [here](https://github.com/aquarists-labs/planning-and-discussion/issues)! Hooray!

## How to set up your environment and run tests

Oh, you definitely can't do that yet. Sorry.

## Be Respectful

Although technical in nature, the Open Source community is first and foremost
about people. Treat other people with respect. Be kind, be open, respect the
culture of the community you are interacting with and be aware of the diversity
of people in that community. Be aware that, particularly in electronic communication,
you might misunderstand or misinterpret what others are saying or meaning. The
reverse is also true.
